# Seinfeld-Scripts

I am a big fan of the show and I was curious about the frequency of common phrases in it.

So, I created a script to scrape script files from a hosting website using BeatifulSoup. 
I then wrote functions that count instances of words and phrases and mapped them to a Pandas dataframe.

Some of the names and phrases I was interested it were Kramer's crazy friend "Bob Sacamano," and Jerry saying "Is that right?"
